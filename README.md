* Data Analysis Question & Answers

## Problem Statement
Before this data can be used properly, we must transform and reshape our dataset.

## Datasets used

The individual datasets for this case study where downloaded from the OSHA Archives.  I condensed, cleaned and structured the data to be able to insert it into a database (osha_fatalities_09-22_complete.csv).

This database has one table named 'fatalities'.
